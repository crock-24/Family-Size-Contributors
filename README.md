# FamilySizeContributors
The objectives of this project are to find out if there is a relationship between Education, Occupation, and Salary with the size of families. There are studies in popular culture that have shown that people are having fewer kids and family sizes are shrinking in nations that have become wealthier and more educated. I would like to investigate if this trend persists while controlling for people within the same area. The data was obtained from the popular website kaggle.com. On kaggle, it is stated that the data was collected by customers on an application that was used for various online food orders in the City of Bangalore. The response variable is the self reported family size of the customer, including the customers themselves. This data was manipulated to place family sizes of 2 or less as a factor level, and family members of 3 or greater as another factor level. The explanatory variables will all be factor variables with levels indicating education level, occupation type, and salary range. The goal is to see if any of these variables are significant predictors for the size of family that was indicated and if there is any significant interaction between these predictors when it comes to predicting family size.
